## Project Overview  
This project develops a robust and reusable system for **parsing, cleaning, and visualizing course dependency data** at Michigan State University. The work focuses on transforming messy course prerequisite/co-requisite data into a **directed graph**, enabling analysis of curriculum structure and student pathways.  

---

## Goals  
- Clean and standardize course requirement data.  
- Parse and interpret prerequisite logic.  
- Construct a directed graph of course/program dependencies.  
- Create static and interactive **visualizations** of the curriculum.  
- Explore relationships between curriculum structure and course outcomes (grades, DFW rates, modality).  

---

## Research Questions  
- How can we reliably extract structured prerequisite relationships from messy data?  
- What does the curriculum structure look like as a dependency graph?  
- Which courses serve as bottlenecks or critical paths?  
- How do student outcomes align with curriculum structure?  

---

## Data  
- **Primary source:** University academic programs and course requirements dataset.  
- **Supplementary source:** [MSU Course Catalog](https://reg.msu.edu/courses/search.aspx) for prerequisites and co-requisites.  

---

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `networkx`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `re` (regular expressions)  
- **Workflow:** Jupyter Notebooks  

---

## Deliverables  
- Cleaned & structured dataset  
- Python scripts for parsing and graph construction  
- Visualizations of curriculum structure (static + interactive)  
- Final report summarizing findings  
- *(Stretch Goal)* Interactive exploration tool for the curriculum graph  

---

## Risks & Backup Plan  
- **Challenge:** Input data may be inconsistent or incomplete.  
- **Fallback:** Develop **semi-automated tools** to support manual cleanup.  
- Note: The project is a **prototype/analysis pipeline**, not production-ready software.

## Community Partner
